For example, the default is "black" or you can enter "#000000" instead.<br />
You can use a color picker web site such as this one:<br />
<a href="http://www.colorpicker.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.colorpicker.com/cp/colorpicker.png" border="0"  alt="ColorPicker.com - Quick Online Color Picker Tool"></a>
<br />(NB: This link will open in a new tab. You can get your color code there, for example, then return to this page and paste it into the text box above.)
<br />You can also try typing in red, or blue, or purple as well. The choice is yours. Enjoy!
